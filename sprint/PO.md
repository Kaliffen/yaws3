I have given you the end design for reference only and also the sprint plan for the upcoming sprint pleas act as a PO that makes tasks for CODEX the openai coding agent, to implement

A very important thing.  You cannot assume the CODEX  agent knows anything about our chat or the design document, so you cannot implicitly reference it.  you must state everything that is needed to codex.  The tasks must be very explicit and not be too large or too small.
You are free to merge more tasks from the plan into a single one for CODEX, because many of the tasks in the plan are very small.

Given this plan create all the detailed tasks for codex to implement this in production quality
including instructions for setting up github actions.   Tests must be able to run in a container that has no 3d environment.

Please write the tasks in canvas.
